  Overview
================

SliProSuperPro is a command line application that controls a Leo Bodnar Electronics SLI-Pro device (https://www.leobodnar.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=185). SliProSuperPro reads the telemetry data from a sim-racing game and displays the gear, RPM, and speed on the SLI-Pro device.

SliProSuperPro currently supports my three favorite games:
- Richard Burns Rally (https://rallysimfans.hu/rbr/index.php)
- iRacing (https://www.iracing.com)
- American Truck Simulator (https://americantrucksimulator.com)

Support for additional games can be added via plugins.

  How To Get It

Windows builds are available via the download page (https://github.com/fixfactory/SliProSuperPro/releases).

  How to Use
================

Simply extract the zip content into a folder and run SliProSuperPro.exe. The application will automatically detect when a supported game is running, read the telemetry and display the data on the SLI-Pro device.

Some games require a manual configuration to output telemetry. Follow the latest instructions found on GitHub (https://github.com/fixfactory/SliProSuperPro/blob/main/README.md).

Use "SliProSuperPro.exe --help" for a list of options.
